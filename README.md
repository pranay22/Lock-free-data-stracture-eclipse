# Lock-free-data-stracture-eclipse

This is the description only for the Lock Free Data Structure project that we did in Implementation of Programming Languages Lab during Summer 2ÃŸ15 semester at TU Darmstadt.  

Code will not be mae available online as that code is internal property of STG dept, TU Darmstadt.  

Goal:  
Measuring the performence of existing 'lock free' data structures of Java and Scala, comparing them, and if needed twicking existing 'lock-free' data structures to improve the performence of them.  
Performence Measurement is done by a speciall tool named "ScalaMeter". URL: https://scalameter.github.io/

Tools Used:  
Scala, Java, ScalaMeter
